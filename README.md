# twitter-sentiment-analysis
A Python-based Twitter sentiment analysis project demonstrating the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in classifying text sentiments. By leveraging models such as Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest Classifier, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 91% and categorise tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
